### Background
I wanted to practice my layout skills, so I've choosen this [PSD template](https://p1xar.github.io/HeyU_Template) as a basis to my website. This template, unfortunatelly, didn't have a mobile version, so I made my own vision on how the website would look on mobile phones and tablets. This projects doesn't have any pre-processors, package managers etc., because it's quite simple and there is no need to make it more complex than it is.
